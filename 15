Lesson-15

Components in vue are reusable piece of code.
When we create a instances like

new Vue({
==
==

})

Then there are only single data objects but

In components, multiple instances can be used. All that instances share the data with some function.

In 15.1 we used component and added a button in it to change the {{ name }}
using data return :

data: function(){
	return "Yoshi";
}

now clicking on the button wont change/alter the output of the other instances like vue-app-two ( its title wont change, because we are doing our work in components) 
but in 15.2

when we used 

var data ={
	name: 'Yoshi' 
}

this function externally at the top, then out javascript runs at the load of the page and hence it changes the data of vue-app-two title too.
(components might save if, we return a fresh object, but in the image, we returned our externally created variable and hence changed the statement of the other instance too)

that's why we use a fresh object each time in return statement of components...
